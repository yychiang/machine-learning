In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "**Answer: **  The three models I chose here are the Decision trees, SVMs, and Gaussian Naive Bayes classifiers. A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a \"test\" on an attribute (e.g. whether a coin flip comes up heads or tails), each branch represents the outcome of the test and each leaf node represents a class label (decision taken after computing all attributes). The path from root to leaf represents classification rules. The advantages of decision tree are that it is easy to understand, does not require large amount of data, and can handle both numerical and categorical data. The major weakness of decision tree is that it is easy to overfit data. The learning algorithm may generate too many rules in order to classify a noise to a desired label. The reason why I chose Decision tree here is that the given data is heterogeneous (that is, features include not only numerical data, but also categorical data). \n",

    "SVM is a power model which can perform nonlinear separation in current feature space. Many applications (especially binary classification problems) adopt SVM as the classification tool. For example, pedestrian detection in computer vision field. The advantages of SVMs are that they are good at dealing with higher dimensional problems, besides, they only consider a small part of data (called the support vectors) to determine the decision hyperplanes. That is, the model doesn't need lots of training data to find a hyperplane. In general, SVM usually doesn't overfit the data. The disadvantage of SVM is that the performance is highly rely on the kernel function. That is, we may not find a good hyperplane if we use a wrong kernel function. SVMs are chosen here mainly because the given data set has many futures, that is, the data set is a higher dimensional one, which may be well manipulated by a SVM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic based method. A famous application is the spam filter (based on counting word frequencies). The advantage of Naive Bayes classifier is that it is very efficient and we can infer the result given only a part of features. More importantly, Naive Bayes learners and classifiers can be extremely fast compared to more sophisticated methods. The disadvantage is that the naive Bayes classifier assumes that features are conditionally independent. This assumption is not suitable in some applications such as digit recognition. Another disadvantage is that if the occurrence of a certain feature is zero in one class, the posterior probability will be zero. Usually we apply a smoother (e.g. Laplace smoother) to remedy this problem. The reasons why I chose Naive Bayes classifiers here are: (1) it is very fast; (2) it is very simple (from the perspective of implementation). In the near future, I would like to implement some machine learning algorithms in a resource-restricted system (e.g., embedded systems for IoT applications). That system has no Scikit-learn package; and everything need to be implemented by myself. I want to experiment whether a Naive Bayes classifier is good enough for dealing with such a classification problem."

    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",
    " - Use a `random_state` for each model you use, if provided.\n",

That is, the trained model overfits the data. The performance of Naive Bayes classifier stands between DT and SVM. The Naive Bayes classifier does not perform well with testing data. It might because the distribution of the small training dataset is not representative. On the other hand, SVM has a balanced f1 score among three models. Although it takes some training time but usually we don't need to train many times if we have a robust model."

    "**Answer: ** In this project, we want to know whether a student will pass or not. In that case, students have to be classified into two classes: \"pass\" or \"not pass\". In the training phase, SVM tries to find a best separate line to separate students into correct classes. The term \"best\" is defined as maximizing the distance between the separate line and both classes. This line will separate the entire space into two regions. To make a prediction, we simply check which region a new data falls in. In some situations we cannot use a line to separate data correctly. However, by taking the distances from each point to the origin into account, we can find that these points can be separated perfectly. Methods to obtain new features like this is called the kernel trick. "
